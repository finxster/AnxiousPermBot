# Anxious Perm Bot

A Cloudflare Worker that automatically tracks PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) case processing times using https://permupdate.com API and sends daily/weekly reports via Telegram.

## Features

- Daily Reports: Monday to Saturday at 6:00 AM UTC
- Weekly Summaries: Sundays at 6:00 AM UTC
- Multiple Recipients: Send to multiple Telegram chats simultaneously
- Smart Analysis: Compare progress with previous reports
- Web Interface: Dashboard to monitor status and trigger manual reports
- Automatic Scheduling: Powered by Cloudflare Cron Triggers

## Prerequisites

1. A Telegram account
2. A Cloudflare account

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
2. Send /newbot command
3. Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "PERM Tracker")
4. Choose a username (must end with bot, e.g., perm_tracker_bot)
5. SAVE the API token provided by BotFather

### 2. Get Your Chat ID(s)

1. Send a message to your new bot (click "START")
2. For single chat: Use your personal chat ID
3. For multiple chats: Get each chat ID and separate them with commas

To get Chat ID:
- Send any message to your bot
- Visit: https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates
- Find chat.id in the response

### 3. Deploy to Cloudflare

1. Go to Cloudflare Workers: https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages
2. Click "Create application" -> "Create Worker"
3. Paste the code from worker.js
4. Click "Save and Deploy"

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In Cloudflare Dashboard, go to your Worker -> Settings -> Variables:

Variable | Description | Example
---------|-------------|---------
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN | Your bot token from BotFather | 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID | Chat ID(s), comma-separated | 123456789,987654321

### 5. Configure KV Storage for Weekly Reports

To enable weekly report history:

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, go to Workers & Pages -> KV
2. Click "Create a namespace" 
3. Name it: `PERM_REPORT_HISTORY`
4. Go to your Worker -> Settings -> Variables -> KV Namespace Bindings
5. Click "Add binding"
6. Set Variable name: `REPORT_HISTORY`
7. Select the KV namespace you created
8. Click "Save"

**Note:** Weekly reports require this KV storage to persist daily report data. Without it, weekly reports will show a "no data available" message, but daily reports will continue to work normally.

### 6. Set Up Cron Trigger

1. In your Worker, go to "Triggers"
2. Click "Add Cron Trigger"
3. Set schedule to: 0 6 * * * (6:00 AM UTC daily)
